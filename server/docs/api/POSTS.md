`limit` and `skip` are also accepted by `GET /posts/user/saved` and

---

## GET /posts/search 🔑

Search posts by title, author, or community. Matches whole words and returns at
most 30 results, newest first.

Post *content* is not searched: image posts store base64 data in that field, so
indexing it produced an enormous index and matched meaningless byte sequences.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `q` | string | Yes | Search query (minimum 2 characters) |

**Success Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "title": "Matching post title",
    "content": "Content containing search term...",
    "author": "johndoe",
    "subreddit": "programming",
    "voteCount": 15,
    "commentCount": 3,
    "timeAgo": "1 day ago"
  }
]
```

**Search Behavior:**
- Case-insensitive search
- Searches across: title, content, author username, subreddit name
- Returns up to 50 results

**Error Responses:**
| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 400 | Query too short (less than 2 characters) |
